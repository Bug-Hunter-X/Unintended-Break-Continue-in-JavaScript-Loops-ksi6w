This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript loops involving the unintended use of break and continue statements.  The `bug.js` file contains code with the error. The `bugSolution.js` shows the corrected code.  This example highlights the importance of carefully considering the conditions under which break and continue statements are used to prevent unexpected behavior and ensure correct loop termination.
